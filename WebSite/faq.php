    <h2>
    Are you going to add focus-follows-mouse support?
  </h2>
  <p>As a long-time Linux user I would love this feature. If anyone can think of
  a cunning way to focus a particular window on demand (preferably without changing the
  window ordering) then tell me and I'll add it into Desktop Manager.</p>
  
    <h2>
    How do I switch desktops without clicking on the pager?
  </h2>

  <p>Switching desktops can be performed either by clicking on the
  desktop preview in the status bar on by using the desktop switch
  hot keys 'Command-Option-Right Arrow' and 'Command-Option-Left
  Arrow'.</p>

  <h2>
    I've hidden the status bar menu, how do I quit the app?
  </h2>

  <p>Control-clicking on the status bar pager also brings up the
  status bar menu with a 'Quit DesktopManager' option.</p>

  <h2>
    I want to temporarily hide that status bar pager. How do I do
    this?
  </h2>

  <p>Either choose 'Hide pager' from the status bar menu or press
  'Command-Option-P'. This hot-key will also show the pager again
  when you want it. This even works if you de-selected 'Show pager
  in status bar at startup' in the preferences.</p>

  <h2>
    Oh my god I love this program so much I want to send you great
    wodges of cash! How can I make you rich?
